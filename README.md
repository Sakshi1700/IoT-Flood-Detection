# IoT-Flood-Detection

<div>
  <p> An IoT prototype for early flood detection, which can help avoid damage post calamity. Flood detection includes sensing temperature, moisture, humidity, and water level. For temperature and humidity, DHT11 Digital Temperature Humidity Sensor is used. The float sensor allows detecting water flow level while HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor has been used to find the distance between the obstacle and the sensor. These all sensors are connected to the Arduino UNO. Once the water level is reached a specific threshold value, it alarms.
